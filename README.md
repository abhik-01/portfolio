<h1 align='center'>Portfolio</h1>

This is my portfolio website build using `Python` & `Flask` web framework.
The design is made using `HTML5`, `BOOTSTRAP 3`, `Javascript` & some `jquery`.
I've used `MongoDB` for the database & `Gunicorn` to serve the application.
Lastly, I've containerized the application using `Docker` & deployed it on `Heroku`.

## All the other projects included in this website are

* ### Diego

  It's a `Deep Learning Neural Network` model capable of identifying a dog's breed.
  The frontend of the model takes a dog's image as an input & follows the `REST Architecture`
  to send the input data to the model. The model then predicts the breed & returns the output result.
  As of now it can identify 120 dog breeds.

  With the help of various `Machine Learning` techniques the model performs pretty fast
  & it has very good accuracy as well.

* ### Hacker News `Web Scraper`

  It grabs the articles from https://news.ycombinator.com/news?, filters them &
  outputs the filtered results.
  
  You can see the application by visiting https://adfolio.herokuapp.com/webscraper.html

* ### Cars & Pedestrians tracker

  This is an `OpenCV` project, able to detect cars & pedestrians. It takes a video file and
  finds out random cars and pedestrians on a road.

* ### Data Visualizer

  It's a `Data Visualizer` build using various `Python` libraries. It can process any large
  dataset, clean that as required & then visualize every individual data point present in the dataset.
